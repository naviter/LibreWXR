# Source Survey

A snapshot of the data sources LibreWXR has evaluated for inclusion in the core project: what shipped, what's queued, what was investigated and ruled out, and the reasoning behind each call. Covers both radar composites and regional NWP grids. The satellite layer (NOAA GMGSI, LW+VIS hourly composite) is covered separately in docs/satellite-implementation-plan.md. WMO CAP weather alerts (severeweather.wmo.int + NWS API) are fetched by src/librewxr/data/alerts_fetcher.py and served at /v2/alerts.

The open-data criteria these decisions apply are documented in [`adding-a-source.md`](adding-a-source.md#upstream-contribution-criteria). Self-hosters running their own LibreWXR instance are not bound by them — this document is the upstream selection record, not a prescription for every deployment.

Tier statuses and endpoint details were re-validated in an August 2026 sweep; dated per-entry notes record what changed.

## Conventions

Sources are tracked across four states:

- **Implemented** — shipping in the current main branch.
- **Tier 1** — validated against the upstream endpoints, ready to implement, no known blockers remaining.
- **Tier 2** — viable but deferred. Some have soft frictions (WAFs, undocumented bounds, missing palette legends); others are blocked on external action (operator outreach, license clarification).
- **Tier 3** — not currently viable. Usually a structural issue: API-key gate, commercial state-owned-enterprise model, app-only distribution, ToU forbids redistribution, or coverage entirely overlaps an existing source.

Sources that shipped and were later removed are recorded in [Reverted and removed](#reverted-and-removed) with the lessons learned. Those reverts informed criteria refinements in `adding-a-source.md` and are worth keeping visible — half of the value of a survey like this is the negative results.

## Radar — Implemented

### United States — IEM NEXRAD and MRMS

Two complementary US sources, selectable via `LIBREWXR_NA_SOURCE`:

- **MRMS** (default) — NCEP Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor, GRIB2 MergedBaseReflectivityQC at 0.01° (\~1 km) on CONUS plus region-aware products for Alaska, Hawaii, Caribbean, Guam. Decoded with eccodes; no GDAL dependency. Anonymous HTTPS at `mrms.ncep.noaa.gov`. US Government public domain.
- **IEM NEXRAD** — Iowa Environmental Mesonet N0Q composites, palette-indexed PNG, uint8 dBZ encoding. Anonymous. Legacy / fallback source.

Regions covered by both: USCOMP, AKCOMP, HICOMP, PRCOMP, GUCOMP. Per-region MRMS products are routed through separate per-product source instances inside the same package.

### Canada — ECCC MSC GeoMet WMS

Region: CACOMP. Source: MSC GeoMet WMS, `RADAR_1KM_RRAI` layer with `Radar-Rain_Dis-14colors` discrete style. Pre-coloured PNG only (no raw data access) — decoded via palette reverse-engineering back to mm/h, then converted to dBZ via Marshall-Palmer Z-R. Resolution: 0.025° (\~2.5 km), \~3560×1720 grid. Anonymous. Selectable independently from the US source via `LIBREWXR_CA_SOURCE`.

### Europe — OPERA Pan-European CIRRUS Composite

Region: OPERA (\~155 radars across 24 countries). Source: EUMETNET OPERA CIRRUS MAX reflectivity via MeteoGate/Cloudferro S3 — anonymous, no key required. ODIM HDF5, float64 dBZ. Resolution 3800×4400 at 1 km, LAEA projection. 5-minute cadence, rolling 24-hour archive. Sentinels: nodata `-9999000.0`, undetect `-8888000.0` (both map to 0 in uint8, so clear sky falls through to the RRQPE bottom radar tier for in-band past frames, then to the NWP chain). URL pattern: `https://s3.waw3-1.cloudferro.com/openradar-24h/YYYY/MM/DD/OPERA/COMP/OPERA@YYYYMMDDTHHMM@0@DBZH.h5`.

The legal lever that opened European radar data is the **EU High Value Datasets regulation (EU 2023/138)**, not WMO policy — it legally requires European meteorological data to be free, open-licensed, and API-accessible.

**Italy is not in the OPERA station list** (CNMCA / DPC are EUMETNET members but historically have not contributed to the EUMETNET composite). What OPERA shows over Italian airspace is edge-of-range data from neighbouring countries (France Côte d'Azur, Switzerland, Slovenia, southern Germany, Croatia, Malta) — wide beam, low SNR, clutter-prone. The DPC source below fills that gap natively.

### Italy — DPC National Radar Composite (VMI)

Region: ITCOMP (group `EUROPE`, sits alongside OPERA — finer pixel_size, so the multi-region compositor lays ITCOMP down first wherever it covers). Source: Dipartimento della Protezione Civile via the open Radar-DPC v2 REST API at `radar-api.protezionecivile.it` — anonymous, no API key. Two-step protocol: `GET /findLastProductByType?type=VMI` returns the most recent epoch-ms timestamp; `POST /downloadProduct` returns a 300–900 s pre-signed S3 URL (`https://dpc-radar.s3.eu-south-1.amazonaws.com/VMI/DD-MM-YYYY-HH-MM.tif`). Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFF (LZW, single-band Float32). Resolution 1200×1400 at 1 km, spherical Transverse Mercator (lat₀=42°N, lon₀=12.5°E, R=6371229 m, k₀=1). 5-minute cadence. No-data sentinel: `-9999.0` (occasionally `-9998.0`).

Network: 24 radars (11 DPC-direct — 7 C-band Gematronik Meteor 600 C and 4 X-band 50 DX — plus 13 partner radars run by regional ARPAs, PAA Trento, ENAV at Linate / Fiumicino, Aeronautica Militare at Capocaccia). License: **Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 (CC-BY-SA 4.0)**, attribution "Radar-DPC" required. The share-alike clause makes this the strictest license in LibreWXR's source stack — derivative tiles must inherit CC-BY-SA, and downstream operators need to surface that.

GeoTIFF decode uses `tifffile` + `imagecodecs` (pure-Python, no GDAL). The `/findLastProductByType` endpoint also lists a `SITES` product type, but `/downloadProduct` rejects it (`productType non supportato`) — there is no public station-list endpoint, so `stations.py` is hand-maintained against the *Allegato 1 — La Rete Radar Meteorologica Nazionale* DPC document (Tabella 1 + 2).

### El Salvador — MARN/SNET San Andrés

Region: SVCOMP (group `CENTRAL_AMERICA`). Single S-band radar at San Andrés, 120 km product (`esar82/Images/`) from the anonymous GCS bucket `radar-images-sv`. Format: PNG with continuous HSV-style hue gradient (green → cyan → blue → magenta on the saturated outer ring); decoded by arc-detect + linear hue → dBZ map. Resolution 409×342 at \~1 km, regular lat/lon. 5-minute cadence, \~24-hour bucket retention. Filenames embed local time (UTC-6, no DST). License: MARN explicitly permits reproduction with citation.

**Implementation surprise worth flagging for any contributor working a similar product**: the published legend image (`escalaPropuesta2013SNEThW_.png`) is for the 60 km multi-radar composite, NOT for `esar82`. The actual 120 km product uses a smooth HSV gradient with no discrete bins. Decoding against the legend's discrete palette yields garbage; decoding against the hue arc yields the right answer.

### Taiwan — CWA QPESUMS Composite

Region: TWCOMP (group `TAIWAN`). Source: CWA O-A0059-001 / 雷達合成回波 on the anonymous AWS S3 bucket `cwaopendata` in `ap-northeast-1`. UTF-8 XML with raw dBZ as comma-separated scientific-notation floats inside a single `<content>` element. Resolution 921×881 at 0.0125° (\~1.4 km), regular lat/lon. 10-minute cadence. Coverage: Taiwan plus a substantial western Pacific buffer for typhoon tracking. License: data.gov.tw Open Government Data License v1.0, attribution required.

URL pattern: `https://cwaopendata.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/history/Observation/{YYYYMMDDHHMM}compref_mosaic.xml` — **no separator dot** between timestamp and product name. The interleaved QPESUMS gauge keys *do* use a dot; easy to mix up. Filename timestamps are Taipei local (UTC+8, no DST). Row order is south-to-north (first value is SW corner) — vertical flip on decode. Datum is TWD67 (sub-pixel offset vs WGS84 at 1.4 km; treated as lat/lon).

### Malaysia — MET Malaysia 12-radar composite

Regions: MYPENINSULAR (Peninsular Malaysia + N. Sumatra + Singapore via KLIA's 240 km Doppler reach) and MYEAST (Borneo + Brunei), both in group `SOUTHEAST_ASIA`. Source: Jabatan Meteorologi Malaysia national radar composite via anonymous HTTPS at `api.met.gov.my`.

Format: animated GIF89a, 1352×570, 6 frames at 10-min cadence (\~60 min of backfill per fetch). Decoded via 18-stop palette → dBZ table (Marshall-Palmer Z = 200·R^1.6 applied to the legend's mm/h stops). Frames cropped to two sub-rectangles. Combined bounding box 96.92–121.19°E × -1.48–9.18°N, split across the South China Sea gap. Single fixed URL `https://api.met.gov.my/static/images/radar-latest.gif` — no per-frame paths. License: CC-BY-4.0 (METMalaysia / api.met.gov.my), attribution required.

**Two implementation gotchas worth documenting for contributors hitting similar products:**

1. **Timestamp anchoring**: the GIF carries no per-frame timestamps (only burned-in chrome text). MET publishes each 10-min slot \~11 min after its real data time, so anchoring the "newest" frame on the real publication time leaves the current slot perpetually empty in the served frames. The fix is to relabel frames against the current wall-clock 10-min slot rather than the upstream timestamp. Configurable lag defaults to 600 s.
2. **State-boundary gaps**: a burned-in state-boundary line leaves hairline gaps in the decoded reflectivity. Post-decode morphological close fills them.

Vendor credit visible in the burned-in chrome ("Rainbow 5 / LEONARDO Germany GmbH") is a tool credit, not a license obligation.

### Global — NOAA Enterprise Rain Rate (RRQPE)

Region: `RRQPE` — a single coarse global radar region covering the 60°S–70°N geostationary ring at all longitudes. Source: NOAA Enterprise Rain Rate GLB-5 blend — satellite-derived **observed** precipitation (IR-based estimate; inputs include GOES-East/West, EUMETSAT Meteosat-9/10, JMA Himawari-9) from the anonymous NOAA NODD bucket `noaa-enterprise-rainrate-pds`. 10-minute cadence, ~17-min publish latency. Native 0.02° grid block-averaged to 0.04° stored at the default downsample. Always-on bottom tier of the multi-region compositor — it fills only pixels no finer radar region claims (past frames within the band), joins radar nowcast extrapolation like any region, and keeps fetching/rendering even under narrow `LIBREWXR_ENABLED_REGIONS` specs.

License: NOAA Open Data Dissemination (NODD) program. Attribution requested — "Precipitation data from NOAA Enterprise Rain Rate (RRQPE)". No endorsement by NOAA implied; don't present modified data as unaltered NOAA data.

### Japan — JMA HRPN Composite (JPCOMP)

**Shipped 2026-05-30** (commit `dfb97c4`, refined in follow-ups).  Analysis-leg only: the N1 manifest (basetime == validtime) feeds a standard `RadarSourceContribution` for the new `JPCOMP` region under the `JAPAN` group.  Forward prediction comes from LibreWXR's internal optical-flow extrapolation like every other region.

Source: `https://www.jma.go.jp/bosai/jmatile/data/nowc/` — anonymous, no auth, no WAF, S3-backed CDN.

- **Manifest:** `targetTimes_N1.json` — JSON array, 36 frames at 5-minute cadence.  Format: `{"basetime": "YYYYMMDDHHMMSS", "validtime": "YYYYMMDDHHMMSS", "elements": ["hrpns", "hrpns_nd"]}`.  We consume `hrpns` only; `hrpns_nd` returns an HTML 404 page when probed (not a real product variant despite appearing in the elements array).
- **Tile pattern:** `…/{basetime}/none/{validtime}/surf/hrpns/{z}/{x}/{y}.png` — 256×256 4-bit palette PNG for populated tiles, 8-bit RGBA all-transparent placeholder for empty tiles.
- **Tile pyramid quirk:** JMA serves real data only at **even zoom levels** (z=4, 6, 8, 10).  Odd zooms (5, 7, 9) return 334-byte transparent placeholders at every coord.  We fetch at z=8 (~420 tiles per frame, ~1.25 km/px), which matches the JPCOMP grid resolution.  z=6 (~30 tiles, ~5 km/px) is the bandwidth-saver fallback.
- **Cadence:** native 5 min; we sample at LibreWXR's 10 min rhythm.
- **Coverage:** all of Japan via 20 C-band Doppler radars fused with the AMeDAS rain-gauge network.  High-quality QPE composite, not a single-radar PPI.

License: **JMA Public Data License v1.0** — CC-BY equivalent, explicit commercial-reuse permission, attribution required ("Source: Japan Meteorological Agency website").  Article 17 of Japan's Meteorological Service Act restricts "provision of meteorological services in Japan" — does not apply to LibreWXR redistributing radar imagery globally, but worth noting for any operator running a Japan-domestic service.

**Removed forecast leg.**  An initial implementation also ingested JMA's N2 manifest (their own 60-min nowcast extrapolation) as a `NowcastContribution` that swapped in for internal optical-flow over JPCOMP.  That path was removed: JMA's 5-min validtime cadence didn't line up cleanly with our 10-min sampling rhythm, and the dispatch complexity wasn't worth the win for one region.  The cleaner long-term play — a regional Japanese NWP overlay so optical-flow blends with high-resolution Japan-specific model precip instead of with global IFS — landed 2026-05-30 as **JMA MSM** in the NWP — Implemented section.

### Philippines — PAGASA PANAHON (PHCOMP)

Reinstated 2026-08-19 (see "Reverted and removed" for history). CDN PNG mosaic, 6-frame 15-min timeline, 9 stations, 2048x2048 grid, SOUTHEAST_ASIA group.

## Radar — Reverted and removed

Two sources shipped and were removed within the same day; PAGASA was later reinstated — see its note below. Both reverts taught something concrete that informed the upstream-contribution criteria.

### Singapore — MSS Changi (shipped and removed 2026-05-15 / 2026-05-16)

Shipped 2026-05-15 as `SEACOMP` (480 km / 30-min, with optical-flow interpolation), migrated to the 50 km / 5-min `SGCOMP` product on 2026-05-16, then removed later the same day. The technical implementation worked fine; the problem was compositing.

When MET Malaysia shipped on 2026-05-16, its KLIA radar (in the MYPENINSULAR region) covered Singapore via the standard 240 km Doppler reach. SGCOMP and MYPENINSULAR disagreed in detail along the SGCOMP rectangle's edges, producing a visible seam in the rendered tiles. Two sources fighting over the same area, neither obviously correct.

The call was to drop the smaller-domain source rather than special-case the seam. Singapore is now covered by MET Malaysia at coarser resolution but visually consistent with the surrounding region.

**Lesson**: when a new source overlaps an existing one, the question isn't just "is the new data better?" — it's "do they agree at the seam?" If they don't, picking one and removing the other is cleaner than trying to feather across them. Same posture as the NWP chain's feathered hand-off, just applied to radar.

If a sharper Singapore-specific layer is wanted again, the path is documented: anonymous HTTPS at `https://www.weather.gov.sg/files/rainarea/50km/v2/dpsri_70km_{YYYYMMDDHHMM}0000dBR.dpsri.png`, RGBA PNG 217×120 at \~0.5 km/px, Singapore Open Data Licence v1.0. The composite-with-MMD seam is the open design problem that blocks re-adoption.

### Philippines — PAGASA PANAHON (shipped and reverted 2026-05-16)

Shipped as `PHCOMP` in group `SOUTHEAST_ASIA` on 2026-05-16 and reverted later the same day. The technical implementation worked; the upstream product was the problem.

PAGASA publishes a single 2048×2048 PNG covering the whole archipelago, but the image carries data only inside each station's range circle. Three of the eight contributing radars (Echague, Kabacan, Panabo) publish at \~80 km rather than the assumed 240 km, leaving the coverage mask claiming radar coverage in areas with no data. This rendered as a sharp black hole over northern Luzon where the mask blocked the IFS fallback. Across a typical frame only \~2065 pixels (\~0.05% of the grid) carried real returns.

**Lesson**: "national mosaic" framing in upstream documentation can be misleading when stations publish at heterogeneous ranges. The negative-space behaviour (where the source claims coverage but has no data) matters as much as the positive-space behaviour, because LibreWXR's coverage mask suppresses the fallback NWP chain inside the claimed area. PAGASA's product is technically a national composite; visually it's eight disjoint circles.

What it would take to revisit: per-station ranges (the current radar infrastructure assumes one range per region), max-pool downsampling for sparse high-res frames at low zoom, and optional disabling of the NWP fallback over PHCOMP to make the rendered output match PANAHON's radar-only appearance. Defensible to leave it removed indefinitely.

Worth noting the license itself was fine — PAGASA's site-wide public-domain statement covered the radar imagery. The revert was a data-quality call, not a licensing one. An open license is a prerequisite for upstream inclusion, but the data also has to be usable in practice.

**Reinstated 2026-08-19.** A re-examination (live probe of six typhoon-season frames plus pixel-level analysis) found the revert's empirical basis mostly didn't reproduce: the ~2065-pixel frame was a dry-season artifact — August frames carry 22–24k precip pixels with 100% exact palette matches, so the decoder was never dropping data — and the 80 km range claim is refuted for every station testable today (uniform ~240 km cap; no range constants exist in the app JS). Kabacan and Panabo remain untested (no rain over Mindanao during the probe window); if they ever prove short-range, `range_overrides` in the source package is the fix. What held: the mosaic is a union of ~240 km station circles, inherent to the source. The network gained a ninth station (Davao) since May. One license nuance now recorded: RA 8293 §176 puts government works in the public domain but requires PAGASA approval for for-profit exploitation — fine for self-hosted AGPL, a caveat for paid hosting. Re-added as a self-discovered package at `sources/regional/southeast_asia/philippines/radar/pagasa/`; the low-zoom max-pool question above remains open but is cosmetic, not structural.

## Radar — Tier 1

Validated against the upstream endpoints. License and access path are clear. Implementation is queued behind whatever else is in flight.

### Bermuda — BWS

Source: weather.bm, anonymous. URL pattern `https://www.weather.bm/images/Radar/CurrentRadarAnimation_500km_dBZ_0deg/{YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM}_500km_dBz_0deg.png` (note mixed casing: `dBZ` in the directory path, `dBz` in the filename). Frame manifest exposed at `https://www.weather.bm/tools/graphics.asp?name=500KM%20PPI` — 5 frames, \~30 min trail, page-scrape pattern. Format: PNG 1032×700, 8-bit RGB, **6-min cadence**, UTC timestamps.

Centre at BWS site \~32.36 °N, -64.69 °W; 500 km range ≈ 28–37 °N × -70 to -59 °W. Projection is almost certainly azimuthal-equidistant centred on the radar (the Selex/Leonardo default). The image has burned-in Bermuda outline + coordinate grid, which should make ground-truthing trivial. Product is dBZ — no Z-R inversion needed.

License: permissive with attribution. BWS disclaimer explicitly permits redistribution of "imagery" provided users acknowledge BWS as the source and quote issue time and validity. The same disclaimer prohibits "deep links, image links, or trademarked 'hot' links without written agreement" — LibreWXR's pattern is server-side fetch + re-render rather than hotlinking, but a courtesy confirmation to BWS is appropriate.

**Coverage value**: this is the largest single gap-fill in the entire radar backlog. USCOMP drops off \~80 km offshore, OPERA is \~3500 km east, MRMS Caribbean (PRCOMP) is \~1500 km south. Bermuda fills a unique slice of the western Atlantic on the hurricane track.

Open questions before implementation: exact palette / dBZ scale (legend needed — sample a precip frame or correspond with BWS); backfill depth (page exposes only 5 frames; older timestamps return 404); projection confirmation. Adding a new `proj="aeqd"` branch to the `RegionDef` machinery is the largest scoped change relative to the existing source pattern.

**Re-validated 2026-08-19:** URL pattern (including the mixed `dBZ`/`dBz` casing), 5-frame manifest, 6-minute cadence, and the disclaimer license text are all unchanged. Backfill is still ~30 minutes — probes at 1 h / 6 h / 24 h before the newest frame all return 404. New additive products since May: 250 km and 100 km SRI variants (5 frames each, same cadence) plus PARISH MAP / HYDROESTIMATOR / UK KINDEX entries in the graphics sidebar. With Cayman moved to Tier 2, Bermuda is now the only unshipped Tier 1 radar source.

## Radar — Tier 2

Sources with viable open access but at least one outstanding blocker — either a license question pending an operator response, a technical friction that adds material engineering cost, or a deferral while higher-value Tier 1s ship first.

### India — IMD

Found 2026-08-19 during a re-survey of the Tier 3 "not investigated in depth" stub — that miss is corrected here. IMD serves a national Doppler mosaic plus per-station products as plain GIFs, anonymously, no auth, no WAF (verified by direct fetch):

- National mosaic: `https://mausam.imd.gov.in/Radar/MOSAIC/Converted/mosaic.gif`
- Per-station example: `https://mausam.imd.gov.in/Radar/caz_delhi.gif` — `radar.php` on the same host lists the full network with MAX / PPI / SRI / accumulation products per station.

Coverage value: the highest of the entire remaining radar backlog — India is one of the largest radar voids on the coverage map.

**Three open items before implementation:**
1. **License**: weak — "© Copyright 2026 … India Meteorological Department" with no open-license statement. `data.gov.in` (the national open-data portal) was unreachable from the research host; check whether IMD publishes radar there under an open license before falling back to an email to IMD.
2. **Palette and bounds**: GIF palette reverse-engineering against the published legend, plus geographic bounds/projection determination — the same shape of work as Malaysia MMD.
3. **Cadence**: unmeasured (~10 min typical of IMD); confirm from frame timestamps.

### Argentina — SMN / SINARAME

17-radar SINARAME network operated by SMN — modern, recently expanded. LibreWXR already consumes SMN's WRF Argentina model from their AWS Open Data bucket (`smn-ar-wrf-dataset`), so same agency, same email contact.

**Blocker**: no SINARAME bucket exists on AWS today. The radar page at `smn.gob.ar/radar` is fronted by Cloudflare's anti-bot interstitial — sustained automated access doesn't work, and bypassing Cloudflare programmatically doesn't fit a self-hostable design.

**Recommended action**: ask SMN's open-data contact (`odp-aws@smn.gov.ar`) whether SINARAME composite reflectivity could be added to the existing AWS Open Data Sponsorship arrangement, similar to how Colombia's IDEAM publishes `s3-radaresideam`. SMN has publicly stated openness in principle ("the beneficial potential of the radars justifies making it public") and the infrastructure pattern is already in place.

If SMN says yes, the format is likely Sigmet IRIS RAW (same as Colombia), which would need `pyart`/`xradar` for decode. Tier 1 candidate at that point. If they say no, defer indefinitely — don't try to scrape past Cloudflare.

Coverage value: significant. WRF-SMN already covers Argentina + Chile + Uruguay + Paraguay + parts of Bolivia and Brazil at 4 km / hourly. Observed radar over the same domain would be a meaningful upgrade from "model only."

**Re-validated 2026-08-19:** unchanged. `smn.gob.ar/radar` still returns Cloudflare 403. The full AWS Open Data Registry tree was checked — the only SMN dataset remains `smn-ar-wrf-dataset` (the WRF model); bucket-name probes (`s3-radar-smn`, `smn-ar-radar`, `sinarame`) all return NoSuchBucket. The `odp-aws@smn.gov.ar` email remains the unlock.

### Mexico — CONAGUA SMN

16-station network with per-station rendered GIF images, no national mosaic. Comparable in shape to the Canada source (palette reverse + Marshall-Palmer Z-R) but with multi-station compositing layered on top — effort estimated at \~3–5× a single-region Tier 1.

Source plumbing (no auth, but SSL cert chain is broken on the host — needs `-k` / cert pinning):
- File listing: `https://smn.conagua.gob.mx/tools/PHP/RDA/static/php/RDA_repository.php?dir=ecos&type=json`
- Image base: `https://smn.conagua.gob.mx/tools/GUI/visor_radares_v3/ecos/{filename}`
- Per-station config: `radarsDB.json` (\~13 MB) carries `radarsInfo` (16 radars), per-product `map.bounds`, `range` km, etc.

Filename pattern: `{STATION}_{PRODUCT}_{MOMENT}_XXX_PXXX_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.gif`. Per-station cadence \~3–5 minutes, not clock-aligned; round to nearest 10-min boundary. SMN does **not** publish a single national composite — the `config.mosaico` entry in `radarsDB.json` is a Leaflet viewer view, not a product. A national MXCOMP would have to be built by max-pooling the 16 per-station rectangles onto a unified grid.

**Blocker**: no open-data licence statement on the smn.conagua endpoints. The NCAR EOL archive of past SMN radar (`https://data.eol.ucar.edu/dataset/82.093`) is research-use-only and explicitly not redistributable. Direct confirmation from `ventanillaunica.smn@conagua.gob.mx` is needed before shipping. Rain Viewer lists SMN as a source, but Rain Viewer's terms aren't AGPL-compatible and they may have a private agreement.

Format gotcha: palette table is not documented. Capture it from a representative reflectivity GIF; the React viewer renders the legend client-side, so the palette table may be embedded in `radarsDB.json` or the JS bundle — worth a deeper search before manual colour-picking.

**Re-validated 2026-08-19:** the data endpoint is still anonymous, live, and current — `RDA_repository.php?dir=ecos&type=json` returns same-day timestamps at ~5–6 min cadence. No national composite exists (`dir=mosaico` returns "Api deny"). The license blocker persists: both the radar info page and the avisos-legales page return HTTP 500, so no terms statement is reachable. Two details worth recording: the `ecos` listing also carries US border NEXRAD stations CONAGUA ingests (YUMA, TUCS, PHNX, BROW, ELPA…) — irrelevant for coverage since MRMS already covers them, but don't mistake them for Mexican network stations when counting; and one station (RIAM) now serves PNG instead of GIF.

### Cayman Islands — CINWS

Moved from Tier 1 on 2026-08-19. The site relaunched (Laravel app) and two things changed:

1. **URL layout rewritten.** Frame manifest is now inline JS (`window.radarFrames[id]` arrays, 10 frames per product, ~70-min PPI trail). Current patterns (all verified live, anonymous, no WAF): PPI 400 km → `https://www.weather.gov.ky/cdn/assets/images/radar/ppi_400km_1k/{TS}dBZ.ppi.jpg`; CAPPI 250 km → `cappi_250km_1k/{TS}dBZ.cappi.jpg`; CAPPI 40 nm → `cappi_40nm/…`; Sister Islands → `Sister_Islands/…`; Rain Rate → `RainRate/{TS}dBR.dpsri.jpg`; plus new Turbulence (`Turbulence/{TS}W.ltb.jpg`) and Wind Shear (`W_Shear/{TS}Shear.hshear.jpg`) products. Timestamp still 16-digit `YYYYMMDDHHMMSSSS` UTC. Cadence is irregular (~6.5–8.4 min between frames), not the clean 5-min the May survey recorded.
2. **License turned restrictive.** The May 2026 "download weather data directly for research, planning and operational use" language is gone. The new `/terms-conditions` page states verbatim: *"The material may be downloaded to file or printer without requiring specific prior permission. Any other proposed use of the material is subject to the approval of the Director General, Cayman Islands National Weather Service."* Re-serving tiles through LibreWRX is unambiguously "any other proposed use" → written approval required.

Bounds remain unpublished. **Action:** email the Director General, CINWS (Box 10022, Grand Cayman KY1-1001; Tel (345) 949-4528) requesting redistribution approval, and ask for product bounds in the same email. If granted, implementation is a JPEG fuzzy-palette decode plus empirical bbox fit — same shape as Bermuda but without the projection question.

### Thailand — TMD

National composite at `weather.tmd.go.th/composite/index_composite.html`, driven by the HAniS animation framework. The radar layer is a transparent overlay (Singapore-style), not baked into a basemap — the architectural prerequisite for being usable. Frames composed from four layered PNGs at 1173×1668 RGBA, of which only `images/zr{NNNN}.png` (\~108 KB, \~525 distinct RGBA colours) is the radar data.

Frame manifest at `images_composite.list` — 24 frames at **15-minute cadence**, 6 hours of rolling archive. Indexed filenames rotate; the manifest is the authoritative index → timestamp map. Always parse it first.

**Three frictions, all real:**

1. **Imperva/Incapsula WAF on the host**, visible from the `<script src="/_Incapsula_Resource?...">` tag. Basic clients work today, but sustained server-IP access is at real risk over time. Mitigations (residential proxy, browser-fingerprint emulation) don't fit a self-hostable design.
2. **No published bounds**. Thailand's geographic bbox doesn't match the image aspect ratio, so either the image extends substantially over neighbouring countries or it uses a non-equirectangular projection. Empirical georeferencing against known features (Bangkok, Phuket, Mae Sai) is required.
3. **License unclear**. Radar composite page says only "Copyright © 2022 Thai Meteorological Department" with no open-data license referenced. Email confirmation from TMD is needed before shipping.

If revisited: the official TMD data API at `data.tmd.go.th/api/index1.php` may have radar imagery on a documented endpoint that bypasses the composite-page WAF — worth checking. WMO WIS2 publication is the other long-horizon trigger.

**Re-validated 2026-08-19:** all three frictions unchanged. The Incapsula WAF is still on the host (`/_Incapsula_Resource?…` script tag present in the page footer). The composite page footer is still verbatim "Copyright© 2022 by Thai Meteorological Department (TMD)"; `disclaimer.html` turned out to be a technical usage-caveat list (ground clutter, anomalous propagation) with no license grant. The official open-data portal `data.tmd.go.th` serves observation APIs anonymously (demo credentials baked into the docs) but carries **no radar product**; its NWP API requires registration. The TMD email remains the only unlock.

### Bahrain / Gulf Cooperation Council (gccmet.net)

URL extraction resolved 2026-05-15: `https://www.bahrainweather.gov.bh/o/ibl-image-player/images/306/cappi_Horizontal-Reflectivity_GCC_YYYYMMDDHHMM`. Anonymous, no session needed. 5-min cadence, clock-aligned, 24-hour archive. The portal is built on Liferay with IBL Software's `ibl-image-player` portlet; the 24-hour frame manifest is baked directly into the rendered HTML.

**Why this could be huge**: a single source covering all six GCC member states (Saudi Arabia, UAE, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Bahrain). Particularly valuable since Saudi Arabia is independently Tier 3.

**Format problems making this harder than estimated**, all newly-discovered during pre-flight:

1. **JPEG-RGB, not PNG-palette**. DCT compression smears RGB triplets across block boundaries, so the standard nearest-colour palette decode is lossy. Fuzzy colour matching with tolerance is needed.
2. **Burned-in coastlines and country borders**. Vector overlay (thin white-grey lines) is rendered into each JPEG, not delivered as a separate layer. Decoding masks the overlay pixels as phantom dBZ unless explicitly masked — and the mask carves no-data holes along every coast.
3. **No bounds published**. Image is approximately Mercator centred \~25°N, 53°E with rough bbox \~14–32°N × 42–62°E, but the bbox must be fitted empirically.
4. **No colormap legend visible in dry-region frames**. Most of the GCC is desert with very few radar returns in normal conditions; legend sampling has to wait for a rain event or guess from IBL Visual Weather's stock palette.
5. **License unclear**. Footer reads "© 2025 Ministry of Transportation and Telecommunications Kingdom of Bahrain"; portal vendor is IBL Software Engineering (Slovakia). No open-data statement.

**Recommended action before writing code**: email gccmet.net or Bahrain MoT asking for a GRIB2/NetCDF/GeoTIFF feed. They publish the visualisation openly, so the marginal ask is small. Most of the engineering cost (JPEG fuzzy decode + coastline masking + bbox fitting) evaporates if they share the underlying raster.

If the email goes nowhere, this sits at the back of Tier 2 behind cleaner-format options. The image-based path is tractable but the cost / value is worse than every Tier 1.

**Re-validated 2026-08-19:** still anonymous and live. URL pattern unchanged; the page manifest currently lists 285 frames at 5-min cadence (~24 h rolling, clock-aligned UTC). A direct frame fetch returned a valid JPEG measured at 1953×1297 px (first actual dimension measurement — the May survey didn't record one). Footer copyright still "© 2025 Ministry of Transportation and Telecommunications Kingdom of Bahrain"; gccmet.net itself was unreachable from the research host. Related development: the UAE's NCM now exposes a `gcc_radars_network` WMS layer (see the UAE entry in Tier 3) — the same GCC-wide product exists behind a 401 gate there while Bahrain serves it openly. The recommended pre-implementation email to Bahrain MoT / gccmet.net stands.

### Bangladesh — BMD

Found 2026-08-19. Per-station radar GIFs listed at `https://www.bmd.gov.bd/radar` (five stations: Dhaka, Cox's Bazar, Khepupara, Molvibazar, Rangpur), with a dedicated fullscreen viewer host at `radar.bmd.gov.bd`. Anonymous access. License weak: verbatim footer "© Copy Rights 2014 - 2026 Bangladesh Meteorological Department. All rights reserved.", and the site runs an "Online Data Purchase" portal for bulk data — a commercial posture signal. Good monsoon-region value adjacent to India's domain; queue behind India, and the same email-first license posture applies.

### Fiji — FMS

Found 2026-08-19. `https://www.met.gov.fj/maps-observation/radar-image/` serves a Fiji Composite plus Nadi / Nausori / Labasa single-station GIF loops (Labasa flagged as down on the page itself). Images are JS-loaded, so exact GIF URLs need extraction during pre-flight. License: "© 2026 Fiji Meteorological Services. All Rights Reserved." Small-island coverage, but Fiji is an RSMC tropical-cyclone region with no current LibreWXR presence. Back of Tier 2.

### Colombia — IDEAM (archive-only)

Anonymous AWS S3 bucket `s3-radaresideam` in `us-east-1`. AWS Open Data Sponsorship Program — clean license. Four radars currently active (Barrancabermeja, Bogota, Guaviare, santa_elena). Format: Sigmet IRIS RAW (.RAWXXXX) volumetric scans — best raw data quality of any source surveyed; this is what `pyart` / `xradar` consume natively for research-grade work. Archive depth: 2018 → present.

**Blocker for the real-time pipeline**: \~24-hour publication delay. Querying today's directory returns zero keys; querying two days back returns data with all `LastModified` timestamps at \~04:04 UTC the following day. Useless for live precipitation overlay where users see "current" weather, but **Tier 1 for an archive/research mode** if LibreWXR ever adds one.

If revisited: trigger is IDEAM shortening the publication delay (would be a meaningful operational change — worth checking annually). Decoding would need `pyart` or `xradar`, which is a meaningful new dependency LibreWXR currently avoids.

**Re-validated 2026-08-19:** delay unchanged at ~24 h (2026-08-18 data landed 2026-08-19 ~04:03 UTC; same-day prefix empty). License confirmed verbatim from the AWS Open Data Registry entry: "Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)". Station roster changed: a new **Munchique** radar is publishing; Bogota, Guaviare, and santa_elena did not appear in sampled recent prefixes (Barrancabermeja + Munchique only). File keys carry a new suffix scheme (e.g. `.RAWTYFP`), suggesting a product/format revision.

## Radar — Tier 3

Sources that aren't currently viable. Most blockers are structural rather than technical — API-key gates, commercial state-owned-enterprise models, app-only distribution policies, or terms of service that explicitly forbid commercial redistribution. Documented so future surveys don't re-discover the same blocker.

### Australia — Bureau of Meteorology

Partially viable but deferred. The FTP composite (IDR00004) at `ftp.bom.gov.au/anon/gen/radar/` is reachable anonymously and the data exists in a documented form (512×512 palette-indexed PNG, 10-min cadence). But:

- **Data licensing unclear**. BOM's copyright notice and automated-access warnings are aggressive; redistribution terms for the anonymous FTP aren't explicitly stated.
- **Projection complexity**. The composite is 512×512 but exact geographic bounds are undocumented. Equirectangular estimates by marker-matching land 25 of 62 markers within 5 px (avg 3.4 px error) — western Australian markers show systematic displacement suggesting meridian convergence, possibly Lambert conformal.
- **WMTS inaccessible server-side**. The higher-quality `api.bom.gov.au` WMTS layer with actual dBZ tiles is behind Akamai CDN that blocks non-browser requests.

If revisited: contact BOM about data access terms; check whether `api.bom.gov.au` has a public API key programme (would still need self-hosting compatibility); study `Makin-Things/bom-radar-card`'s projection handling for the WMTS approach.

### South Korea — KMA

API-key gated. KMA's Open MET Data Portal at `data.kma.go.kr` does offer radar data, but access requires registration and a per-developer API key. Automatic Tier 3 under the no-API-keys rule (`adding-a-source.md`). Licence itself is dual-marked KOGL (Korea Open Government License) + Creative Commons and would otherwise be fine; the credential gate is the disqualifier.

Trigger to revisit: KMA publishes anonymous radar endpoints, e.g. via the AWS Open Data Sponsorship Program. They already did this for GK-2A satellite data (`noaa-gk2a-pds` bucket is anonymous), so the precedent exists within the same agency. Same trigger pattern as Indonesia BMKG.

### Netherlands — KNMI

ODIM HDF5 data is available but requires free API-key registration. Automatic Tier 3 under the no-API-keys rule. Coverage also overlaps entirely with OPERA, so even if the API gate were lifted the marginal value would be near-zero.

### Finland — FMI standalone

`fmi::radar::composite::dbz` via WMS — raw uint8 GeoTIFF, anonymous, free. Skipped because coverage overlaps entirely with OPERA. Only useful in deployments where OPERA is disabled.

### New Zealand — MetService / NIWA

Structural blocker. Both NZ meteorological agencies operate under commercial mandates that prevent unauthenticated public radar publication.

- **MetService open-access tier** is SFTP-by-email (`data.manager@metservice.com`) — credential-gated, equivalent to an API key under the upstream criteria.
- **MetService modern API** at `data.metservice.com` is explicitly API-key gated.
- **NIWA** operates a commercial delivery model (web interfaces, contracted APIs, GIS).

MetService is a State-Owned Enterprise, required by mandate to operate commercially. MBIE's *Weather Permitting* review (2024-ish) explicitly flagged this: *"access to observational weather data in New Zealand is more restricted compared with some other countries, largely because of the state-owned enterprise (SOE) and Crown research institute (CRI) models."* Neither agency is going to mirror radar to anonymous AWS/CDN, because that would undercut their own commercial offerings.

Trigger to revisit: NZ government policy change repurposing MetService away from the SOE model, or MetService voluntarily publishing radar to a CC-BY-licensed anonymous endpoint. Neither is on the horizon.

### Costa Rica — IMN

Paid / service-request model. IMN's data offerings explicitly note "information has associated costs depending on what is requested" — a pay-per-request model administered through service-request forms. AGPL self-hosted redistribution is incompatible with per-request paid licensing.

### Brazil — CPTEC/INPE sigma

Demoted from Tier 2 on 2026-08-19: the feed is confirmed dead/stale. The `dados_radar.json` catalog still serves, but its first entries are dated **2018-04-26** — confirming the staleness the May survey flagged as a risk. Current-dated image URLs under the documented `repositorio7/...` scheme return 404, and the sigma viewer page itself displays "Radares indisponíveis no momento" ("radars unavailable at the moment"). Path A (DECEA REDEMET) remains API-key-gated. With the aggregation feed stale, Brazil has no viable anonymous radar source.

Trigger to revisit: CPTEC/INPE revives the sigma aggregation with fresh timestamps (check the catalog's first-entry dates), or one of the five constituent networks (INPE, DECEA, IPMet, CEMADEN, CENSIPAM) publishes its own open feed.

### Hong Kong — HKO

Technically reachable anonymously (manifest at `nradar_img.json`, 6-min cadence, JPEG 577×400 at 64/128/256 km ranges), but the licence explicitly prohibits commercial redistribution: *"the use of the Materials for commercial purposes is strictly prohibited unless... prior written authorisation is obtained."* Radar imagery is **not** on the `data.gov.hk` Open Data API — the permissive open-data terms don't cover it.

If the licence ever opens, implementation effort would be \~1.5–2 days. The product is rainfall rate (mm/h, 13 discrete bins), not raw dBZ — would need Marshall-Palmer inverse. Burned-in logo / legend / range rings / Chinese text / terrain basemap, plus circular crop with corner-fill, plus JPEG lossy compression all make palette matching harder than a clean PNG-palette source.

Trigger to revisit: HKO adds radar to `data.gov.hk` (where they already publish warnings, climate, station data under permissive terms).

### France — Météo-France (Données Publiques Radar API)

API-key gated — automatic Tier 3 under the no-API-keys rule. One API covers metropolitan France plus the overseas domains (Nouvelle-Calédonie, Antilles, Réunion) at 5-minute cadence, which is why this entry absorbs the former Antilles-Guyane Tier 2 entry. Prompted by GitHub issue #21 (2026-08-06, an operator reporting a working self-hosted integration); verified against Météo-France's current documentation on 2026-08-19.

**Access.** Requires account registration + a free per-application subscription + a time-limited Bearer token (\~1 h validity) — verbatim from the quick-start guide: *"Sans token valable, l'API refuse toute requête, même si vous êtes bien inscrit et abonné."* Gateway base: `https://public-api.meteofrance.fr/public/<API>/v1/...`. The licence itself is fine (*"Sans redevance sous Licence Ouverte d'Etalab. La source à indiquer est "Météo-France"."*) — the credential gate is the sole disqualifier: every self-host operator would need their own Météo-France account, which is exactly what the rule guards against.

**Products** (from the "Données radars" documentation page):

- Reflectivity is **BUFR-only at every resolution** (individual 1 km, PAM 240 m, PAG 1 km, and the 1 km mosaic). The BUFR uses a custom non-dBZ encoding (a 0–79/255 code lookup) with Météo-France local descriptor tables — the docs ship those tables as a downloadable CSV zip and the FAQ acknowledges the values "ne sont pas directement exprimées en décibels Z". This is exactly why eccodes loads the message but fails on unpack, as the issue author found. A bespoke BUFR decoder is theoretically possible, but it is not ODIM.
- The **500 m HDF5 mosaic is rain accumulation** ("lame d'eau", 1/100 mm), not reflectivity — so a working integration derives dBZ via Marshall-Palmer (same shape as the IFS path) rather than decoding measured reflectivity. The issue author's "500 m ODIM HDF5 composite" conflates the two products; "ODIM" is not claimed in the docs.
- **Near-real-time only.** Historical radar is distributed on-request via FTP; the real-time endpoints serve only the newest slots. Operator-reported runtime detail (issue #21 — consistent with the docs, not independently verified): the product endpoint silently ignores `date` / `time` / `referencetime` / `validity_time`, and the packet endpoint holds only the last 3 slots (\~15 min), so a deployment fills its frame store forward with no backfill on cold start.

**The anonymous path is dead.** The `rwg.meteofrance.com` WMS (the basis of the former Antilles-Guyane Tier 2 entry) was retired between 2026-08-06 and 2026-08-19: every WMS/WFS/GetMap path returns 404 (never 401/403) and the host serves only a "Welcome on rpcache service!" placeholder. The viewer JS now points at a non-public `rpcache-aa-integration.meteofrance.com` host, and the old geoservices catalogue states the unique-key method was deactivated in favour of the API portal. Per issue #21 the rwg route also covered metropolitan France with a \~48 h archive — moot now that the host is gone. The old mfsession/rot13-JWT recipe is preserved in git history if the service ever returns.

Trigger to revisit: Météo-France publishes a real-time radar raster to an anonymous channel — `meteo.data.gouv.fr` is the plausible host, since it already carries the COMEPHORES hourly accumulation reanalysis (1997–present, GeoTIFF, metropolitan France) — or the project ever relaxes the no-API-keys rule.

### Saudi Arabia — NCM

No anonymous public radar URL exists. NCM's ArcGIS Hub publishes climate, surface station, and alert data but conspicuously no radar. `meteo.ncm.gov.sa` is a registered-user portal (MeteoKSA). `beta.ncm.gov.sa` doesn't resolve from non-Saudi hosts.

Evidence the data is gated: the third-party viewer at `radar-flask.xyz` displays NCM radar with KML overlays, but its JS calls `/radar_image_proxy/${colormap}/${ts}` — a backend proxy on its own server, not direct NCM URLs. The proxy exists precisely because direct anonymous access doesn't work; the operator likely registered for MeteoKSA and runs the proxy from their own infrastructure. LibreWXR can't follow that path — would require either every self-hoster getting MeteoKSA credentials (API-key rule violation) or routing through a central proxy (not self-hostable).

Trigger to revisit: NCM publishes radar to their ArcGIS Hub, to anonymous AWS/CDN, or via a documented free-tier API on `data.ncm.gov.sa` or similar.

**Re-checked 2026-08-19:** ncm.gov.sa relaunched ("enhanced digital platform") with a new "Direct API Integration" service — but it covers forecasts and early warnings only, no radar. MeteoKSA is still login-gated (`demometeoksa.ncm.gov.sa/auth/login`); `beta.ncm.gov.sa` still does not resolve. No change to the revisit trigger.

### Mongolia — NAMEM

Probed 2026-08-19. Radar hardware exists (JICA-granted C-band network; NAMEM's own open-data page names a senior specialist responsible for the "radar network"), and `weather.gov.mn` has a public "Радар" tab — but the site is a Next.js SPA pulling from an undocumented internal API (`/api/get/radar` → 404; only `/api/get/forecasts` is exposed). No static raster endpoint found. NAMEM additionally runs a paid tariff page for data/archive services (`namem.gov.mn/p/service-prices`), and no open license appears anywhere (footer "© 2026 NAMEM").

Trigger to revisit: NAMEM publishes radar rasters to a documented anonymous endpoint, or opendata.gov.mn (currently a JS SPA, not enumerable server-side) lists a radar dataset under an open license.

### United Arab Emirates — NCM

Found 2026-08-19. `ncm.gov.ae` (new canonical host, formerly ncm.ae) exposes radar layers in its SPA config — notably `gcc_radars_network` and `uae_radars_network` WMS layers on `tiles2.ncm.gov.ae`. Every probe (WMS GetCapabilities, GeoServer paths) returns HTTP 401 — a credential-gated GeoServer, failing the anonymous rule. Footer "© National Center of Meteorology 2026". Notable because it proves a GCC-wide radar composite product exists on the UAE side too — Bahrain serves the same composite openly (see the GCC entry in Tier 2).

Trigger to revisit: `tiles2.ncm.gov.ae` drops the auth requirement on the WMS.

### Kuwait — DGCA Meteorological Department

Found 2026-08-19. Radar pages exist at `met.gov.kw/Radar/maxz.php` (MAXCAPPI 125 km) and `maxz_250.php` (250 km) but currently serve a maintenance placeholder. Disqualifying regardless — verbatim footer: *"It is not allowed to broadcast, publish, or amend any part of the site and the information it contains without prior written approval by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation."* Explicit redistribution prohibition backed by law No. 64/1999 — same class as Hong Kong.

Trigger to revisit: an open-data license or written approval appears.

### Oman — CAA Directorate General of Meteorology

Found 2026-08-19. New portal at `met.caa.gov.om` (WordPress; `met.gov.om` redirects there). Parts of the site are login-gated (free-account registration), and no anonymous radar image/tile endpoint was found in the pages fetched.

Trigger to revisit: an anonymous radar endpoint or open-data publication.

### Turkey — MGM

\~25-radar national network, but no open raw data. `www.mgm.gov.tr/sondurum/radar.aspx` serves rendered PNG snapshots only — per-station products and a national "combined" composite. Latest snapshot only, no time-series archive, no documented API, no published terms of use. The raw data lives behind MEVBİS (`Meteorolojik Veri-Bilgi Sunum ve Satış Sistemi` — literally "Sales System"), MGM's commercial portal with per-request licensing.

Turkey is fully inside the ICON-EU domain (29.5–70.5°N, 23.5°W–62.5°E), so the loss is \~155 km radar resolution → 7 km model resolution, not radar → 9 km IFS. Material but bounded.

Trigger to revisit: MGM joins OPERA (talked about for years, no movement) or publishes an open-data radar feed.

### Vietnam — NCHMF

Policy-blocked. The official site at `nchmf.gov.vn` is unreachable or intermittently slow from outside the country, but the deeper blocker is that the World Bank's SE Asia hydromet policy note explicitly identifies Vietnam as one of the countries where regional hydromet data sharing is not yet achieved — data access is restricted by national policy, not a documentation gap. Matches the regional pattern across Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Vietnam.

Trigger to revisit: Vietnam publishes radar to WMO WIS2 (currently sparse — only a few countries publish radar metadata there, and Vietnam is not among them).

### Indonesia — BMKG

App-only distribution policy. The national composite URL `https://inderaja.bmkg.go.id/Radar/Indonesia_ReflectivityQCComposite.png` is documented, but all `/Radar/*` requests return HTTP 301 → a generic splash image. BMKG's own viewer page states: *"Currently radar weather imagery can only be accessed through the Info BMKG application."* The open-data portal `data.bmkg.go.id` publishes forecasts, earthquakes, and nowcast alerts but radar is conspicuously absent.

Trigger to revisit: BMKG adds radar to `data.bmkg.go.id` (where they already publish forecasts/earthquakes/nowcasts under a citation-required open licence). If that happens, BMKG jumps straight to Tier 1 — the composite product clearly exists and the agency is comfortable with the open-data model for other products. This is the most promising future SE Asia candidate if the policy ever flips.

### South Africa — SAWS

Probed 2026-08-19. `weathersa.co.za` is a React SPA behind Cloudflare challenge scripts (`cdn-cgi/challenge-platform`) — not server-side fetchable. SAWS also operates a commercial data-sales model. Southern Africa remains a radar void.

Trigger to revisit: SAWS publishes radar to an anonymous endpoint or the AWS Open Data program.

### China — CMA (radar)

Probed 2026-08-19, complementing the existing CMA NWP entry in the NWP Tier 3 section. Public radar mosaics exist only as JS tile maps (`weather.com.cn/radar/`, tiles on `i.tq121.com.cn`) with no clean static raster; `data.cma.cn` is a registered-access portal and the public sites carry "All Rights Reserved" notices. Same structural blockers as the model side.

Trigger to revisit: mirrors the CMA NWP trigger — an anonymous data channel or AWS Open Data publication.

### Iceland — Vedur.is

Only pre-coloured images with map backgrounds baked in (540×383 PNG with grid lines, coastlines, legends). Not usable as a tile overlay. Same shape of blocker as Turkey but smaller.

### Morocco — DMN / DGM

WMO WIS2 infrastructure-provider status (one of 11 global hub nodes) is institutionally significant on paper, but doesn't translate to a public radar feed. Maroc Météo operates 7–9 weather radars (the original 7-station fleet plus 2018 additions at Tan-Tan and Erfoud, with 5 more from a 2023 Baron Weather contract expected through mid-2024). No anonymous radar endpoint has been published.

- `marocmeteo.ma/fr/radar` is a Drupal route that returns 404 with no radar content — the page exists in the URL space but isn't populated for public access.
- `data.gov.ma` (Morocco's national open-data portal) lists **0 datasets across all 8 thematic categories**, including meteorology. Effectively empty.
- `extranet.marocmeteo.ma` returns HTTP 200 but is credential-gated.
- Rain Viewer's Morocco page lists exactly one station (MA2755 Debdou) and returns server errors — same pattern as pre-war Ukraine, suggesting a feed that once worked and now doesn't.

Same shape of blocker as Saudi NCM: engaged with WMO open-data sharing at a meta level (in Saudi's case the ArcGIS Hub, in Morocco's case the WIS2 hub provider role), but radar specifically is not on any anonymous endpoint. The WIS2 hub status is therefore a *warm institutional signal* but not an actionable trigger by itself.

Coverage value if ever unblocked would be substantial — North Africa is currently a near-total radar void in our coverage map. A Moroccan composite would meaningfully fill an empty quadrant.

Trigger to revisit: DMN publishes radar to `data.gov.ma` (which would also require the portal to actually have content, currently it does not), or to an anonymous AWS bucket / CDN, or via a documented free-tier API on a `data.marocmeteo.ma` subdomain. No specific signal of any of these.

### Ukraine — UHMC

Pre-war Ukraine had a small radar network operated by State Enterprise «UAMC» under the Ukrainian Hydrometeorological Center: Boryspil (UKBB) near Kyiv, relaunched April 2019 after years of dormancy, plus Zaporizhya (UKDE) listed historically by aggregators. Per the Ukrainian Hydrometeorological Center Wikipedia entry, *"Weather radar (operated by SE «UAMC» and relaunched in 2019, it was destroyed in 2022 during Russian invasion."* Many other surface stations were also lost or damaged.

Current state (2026-05): `meteo.gov.ua` has no radar product in its public navigation, only forecasts, Meteosat-derived satellite composites, and warnings. Rain Viewer still lists UKBB+UKDE but the upstream WMS returns server errors for both — consistent with a long-term outage rather than a transient blip. Ukraine is not a EUMETNET member, so its radars were never part of the OPERA composite either. Aggregators currently displaying "Ukraine radar" (AccuWeather, Weather.com, meteoblue) are showing model-derived precipitation, not radar returns — LibreWXR instead uses RRQPE observed precipitation (satellite-derived, 60S-70N band) over such uncovered in-band regions for past frames, with the model layer only poleward / fringe / RRQPE-decline.

A different shape of Tier 3 blocker from the rest of this section: not licence, not policy, not API-key — infrastructure unavailable. The same shape applies in principle to other countries with ongoing severe disruption (Gaza, Sudan, Yemen); not worth surveying proactively, the agency announcement is the trigger.

Trigger to revisit: UHMC publicly announces a restored radar with a data feed. Most likely path is a post-war reconstruction project with WMO and/or EUMETNET assistance. Secondary trigger: Ukraine joins EUMETNET OPERA — `OperaSource` would pick it up automatically once a Ukrainian station appeared in the OPERA station list.

### Russia — Roshydromet

**Project-policy exclusion.** LibreWXR will not ingest data from Russian state meteorological agencies for as long as the Russian Federation continues its invasion of Ukraine. Technically the data is reachable; the exclusion is a values-based decision, not a technical or licensing limitation, and it would remain in effect even if Roshydromet published radar under CC-BY-4.0 tomorrow.

The pairing with the Ukraine entry above is deliberate. Ukraine's radar infrastructure was destroyed by Russia, so LibreWXR neither pretends Ukraine has coverage (Tier 3 — infrastructure unavailable) nor accepts the aggressor's data as a substitute (Tier 3 — project-policy exclusion). Ingesting and redistributing data from a state agency of an aggressor government, even data as politically neutral as precipitation radar, normalises that state's institutional standing during an ongoing war of aggression. LibreWXR declines to do that.

Technical context, recorded so the research isn't redone if policy ever changes:

- **Operator:** Hydrometcenter of Russia, part of Roshydromet.
- **Network:** DMRL-C (Doppler Meteorological Radar — C-band), built by LEMZ. Roughly 40 modern C-band stations across European Russia, comparable in capability to OPERA-tier members.
- **Coverage:** European Russia only. The product page at `meteoinfo.ru/en/radanim` explicitly scopes itself "for the European part of the country." Siberia and Far East are not in the product, and DMRL-C deployment east of the Urals is sparse anyway.
- **Endpoint:** `https://meteoinfo.ru/hmc-output/rmap/phenomena.gif` — anonymous, HTTP 200, no WAF, `Cache-Control: no-store`, \~14 MB, 1200×1200 GIF89a, animated 3-hour loop.
- **Format:** Burned-in chrome palette GIF (legend, geography, borders). No raw dBZ. Would need palette reverse-engineering, same shape as Malaysia MMD.

Secondary blockers that would also need resolving if the policy block were ever lifted: no licence grant (the page carries `© Hydrometcenter of Russia` and nothing else — worse than Hong Kong, which at least *grants* non-commercial use); and Roshydromet is not on the WMO WIS2 infrastructure-provider list, so the WIS2 path doesn't exist either.

Coverage cost is acknowledged honestly: European Russia is the largest contiguous Eurasian radar void in our coverage map. OPERA's eastern edge sits at roughly the Baltic states + Belarus + Black Sea, and the gap east of that is substantial. The decision is not free of cost.

No re-evaluation trigger tied to data access, licence, or WIS2 publication. The only relevant change of circumstance is the end of the war and a meaningful change in the Russian government's posture toward Ukraine.

### Rapid triage notes (2026-08-19)

One-line outcomes from the same sweep, recorded so they aren't re-probed blindly: **Kazakhstan** (Kazhydromet) — radar viewer exists at `kazhydromet.kz/vc/radar_viewer/` but states "radar data temporarily unavailable"; all-rights-reserved footer. **Israel** (IMS) — composite radar player exists but is a JS SPA behind a mandatory terms-of-use consent prompt (mirrors the NWP-side ToU friction). **Kenya** (KMD) — `meteo.go.ke` carries satellite imagery but no public radar product. **Unreachable from the research host** (timeouts, bot checks, or redirect loops — unverified, not confirmed-absent): Chile (meteochile.gob.cl), Cuba (insmet.cu), Iran (irimo.ir), Egypt (ema.gov.eg), Pakistan (pmd.gov.pk), Nigeria (nimet.gov.ng), Qatar (qweather.gov.qa).

## Satellite — Implemented

### NOAA GMGSI (LW + VIS) — shipped 2026-05-24

Hourly global mosaic (±72.7 deg), VIS-over-LW composite with day/night terminator, S3 bucket noaa-gmgsi-pds. See docs/satellite-implementation-plan.md for the full record.

## NWP — Implemented

LibreWXR's NWP chain blends multiple regional models on top of a global base, dispatched per-pixel via feathered hand-off. Lower priority numbers run first.

### HRRR-CONUS (priority 10)

3 km native LCC, NOAA S3 anonymous bucket `noaa-hrrr-bdp-pds`. Uses `wrfsubhf` for native 15-min steps plus linear interpolation (no optical flow needed at native cadence). Native `composite_reflectivity` (REFC) — no Z-R conversion. Snow mask supported via the shared `compute_snow_mask` helper.

### HRRR-Alaska (priority 11)

Same model as HRRR-CONUS, disjoint domain. 3 km native polar stereographic, hourly `wrfsfcf` (no subh available). Same `noaa-hrrr-bdp-pds` bucket, `/alaska/` prefix, `.ak.grib2` filename infix. Publishes \~80 minutes after run init (later than CONUS subh). Linear interpolation only — optical flow deferred per the original integration plan.

### HRDPS (priority 20)

ECCC continental at 2.5 km native rotated lat/lon, 6-hourly cycles, 1-hour APCP accumulation. Anonymous HTTPS via dd.weather.gc.ca date-prefixed archive path. Implementation gotcha worth flagging: ECCC GRIB stores rotation as **south pole** at (-36.08852°, 245.305°); the LibreWXR code uses **north pole** at the antipode, which is the same physical rotation but the rotated-lon axis runs backwards through the grid (col 0 = highest rlon). Sign flip in the column equation; verified against all four GRIB corners. Variable comes back as `unknown` (paramId table miss in cfgrib), not `tp` — fall back to first-2D-var-matching-shape.

### AROME Antilles (priority 25)

Météo-France 1.3 km native / 2.5 km public distribution (0.025° regular lat/lon, with NaN mask outside the trapezoidal native grid). Anonymous HTTPS via the OVH Swift bucket at `meteofrance-pnt.s3.rbx.io.cloud.ovh.net` (Météo-France migrated PNT distribution off `object.data.gouv.fr/meteofrance-pnt/` around 2026-01; the data.gouv.fr API still works but its file links now 302 to OVH). 4 cycles/day (00/06/12/18Z), 0–48 h horizon. License: Etalab Open Licence v2.0. Scan mode 0 (row 0 = north, no flip needed) — the first source where this is the case. `tp` shortName recognised directly (no paramId fallback). Cumulative-since-init precip → diff against prior step → Marshall-Palmer Z-R.

Snow mask not enabled — the domain is tropical.

### AROME Guyane (priority 26)

Same upstream + family base as AROME Antilles. URL token `GUYANE`. Domain ~1156 × 877 km covering French Guiana plus the eastern strip of Suriname and a sliver of Amapá, Brazil. Pairs with Antilles to give continuous Caribbean → Guianas coverage. Domain back-decoded from GRIB Section 3 on 2026-05-21.

### AROME Indien (priority 27)

URL token `INDIEN`. The largest AROME-OM grid at ~3742 × 2492 km — covers Réunion, Mayotte, the Comoros, almost all of Madagascar, and the Tanzanian coast. ~70 MB RAM is the highest memory cost of any AROME-OM variant, so disable it if low on memory and not serving Indian Ocean clients.

### AROME Nouvelle-Calédonie (priority 28)

URL token `NCALED`. Domain ~1357 × 1360 km covering New Caledonia + Loyalty Islands + the southern half of Vanuatu.

### AROME Polynésie (priority 29)

URL token `POLYN`. Domain ~1365 × 1404 km covering the Society Islands (Tahiti, Bora Bora) and the Tuamotu archipelago. The Marquesas are outside the public 0.025° grid even though they're part of the operational model's footprint. An earlier survey claimed Polynésie ran 12-hourly, but a bucket probe on 2026-05-21 confirmed 6-hourly cycles like every other AROME-OM variant.

### DMI HARMONIE-AROME DINI (priority 30)

2 km native LCC, 3-hourly cycles. Anonymous AWS S3 bucket `dmi-opendata` in `eu-north-1` (`--no-sign-request`). No `.idx` files — uses byte-range header walk to find the precip message offset. Domain covers UK + Ireland, France, Benelux, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, northern Italy, Czechia, Poland, **all of Scandinavia including most of Finland**, Denmark, and Iceland (DMI's published computational grid extends past the marketing maps).

Outside the DINI domain: Iberia, southern Italy, Greece, Balkans, Belarus / Ukraine, the very-northern tip of Norway, and Murmansk. ICON-EU fills those at priority 35.

### ICON-EU (priority 35)

7 km lat/lon, 3-hourly cycles. DWD opendata at `opendata.dwd.de/weather/nwp/icon-eu/`. `tot_prec` accumulated; difference consecutive steps for hourly rate; Marshall-Palmer Z-R with +12 dBZ default calibration offset against OPERA radar.

### WRF-SMN Argentina (priority 40)

4 km LCC, first regional NWP for the South American Cone. Anonymous AWS Open Data bucket `smn-ar-wrf` in **us-west-2** (the registry page suggested us-east-1; bucket-region header revealed otherwise). 4 cycles/day (00/06/12/18Z), 72 h horizon. License: CC BY 2.5 Argentina, AGPL-redistributable.

**First non-GRIB source in the chain** — uses NetCDF4/HDF5 via h5py. Spherical LCC, single tangent at -35°S, sphere R = 6,370,000 m (1,229 m smaller than the usual WMO sphere; calibrated against the file's `Lambert_Conformal` grid_mapping attrs and 2-D lat/lon coord arrays). Southern-hemisphere LCC subtlety: `n = sin(-35°) < 0`, but the projected y still increases going north because the `n < 0` sign already lives in F and ρ_0. `PP` field cumulative-since-init mm → diff → Marshall-Palmer.

Per-file size (\~34 MB NetCDF4) makes serial download painfully slow, so this source uses a **parallel fetch pipeline** (concurrency 6) — Phase 1 downloads accumulations in parallel, Phase 2 walks them sequentially per run to compute diffs. Other sources don't need this since their files are 1–9 MB.

### JMA MSM (priority 20)

5 km native (0.0625° lon × 0.05° lat) over 22.4–47.6°N × 120–150°E — Japan + Korean Peninsula + Taiwan + Yellow Sea + adjacent waters of the western Pacific. 8 cycles/day (00/03/06/09/12/15/18/21 UTC), hourly forecast steps, 78 h horizon from the 00Z/12Z main runs (39 h others; we only fetch the ~3-hour window around now in either case). Distributed via Open-Meteo's anonymous AWS Open Data mirror at `s3://openmeteo/data_spatial/jma_msm/` in `us-west-2` — the same bucket as IFS. License: redistributed under Open-Meteo's AWS Open Data Sponsorship terms; original JMA data is the Mesoscale Model GPV.

**Workaround for the previously-blocked JMA NWP feed.** JMA's direct distribution channel (JMBSC) is paid-contract-only with terms that don't permit AGPL self-host redistribution. Open-Meteo separately republishes MSM precipitation, temperature, wind, and pressure-level fields to AWS Open Data via the sponsorship arrangement — the same arrangement that makes IFS, NCEP, and DMI usable. LFM (2 km local model) and MEPS ensemble are **not** mirrored — only MSM is. Same `.om` container format we already decode for IFS via `omfiles.OmFileReader`. Single fetch per (run, valid-time) carries every variable; per-step file is \~800 KB.

Pairs with the JMA HRPN radar composite (JPCOMP, analysis-only post-revert) to give Japan a proper mesoscale NWP overlay instead of falling through to global IFS for the model side of the nowcast blend.

### ECMWF IFS (priority 1000, terminal model)

9 km native (O1280 reduced Gaussian → regridded to 0.1° lat/lon). Open-Meteo S3 mirror, CC-BY-4.0. Provides pseudo-reflectivity (precipitation rate → dBZ via Marshall-Palmer) plus snow/rain classification globally. Optical flow interpolation of hourly IFS → 10-minute frames. IFS is the terminal model of the chain — it provides model coverage everywhere a regional model isn't running. For past frames within the 60S-70N band that means it answers only poleward of the band, in the 2-degree fringe excluded by RRQPE's coverage polygon, and when RRQPE declines: the observed band layer is NOAA RRQPE, an always-on radar region (see Radar — Implemented), not IFS.

## NWP — Tier 2

Open access and additive value, but lower priority than what's currently shipping.

### UK Met Office UKV

1.5 km native / 0.018° (\~2 km) public distribution on AWS Open Data Registry (`registry.opendata.aws/met-office-uk-deterministic/`), anonymous. 8 cycles per day, **2-year rolling archive** (unusually long). License: **CC BY-SA 4.0** — ShareAlike clause is the only complication. Code (AGPL) and data (CC BY-SA) are separate works so combining is generally fine, but downstream tile redistribution carries the SA obligation.

Domain: UK + Ireland — high overlap with DMI DINI (already 2 km native over the same area), so the upgrade is marginal at typical zooms.

### Italy — ICON-2I

2.2 km native, 72 h horizon. ItalyMeteo. Would fill the southern Italy gap below DMI DINI's southern edge. Access details (license, fetch path) need verification — the catalog metadata was thin.

The cadence is a real downside: **12-hourly cycles** mean the forecast at "now" can be 10+ hours stale by next-cycle time. ICON-EU's 3-hourly cycles are fresher more of the time despite the lower resolution.

### AROME Réunion-Mayotte / French Guiana / New Caledonia / French Polynesia

**Shipped** — see AROME Indien (Réunion/Mayotte), AROME Guyane, AROME Ncaled, and AROME Polyn under NWP — Implemented. The standalone "Réunion-Mayotte" domain no longer exists as a separate product; AROME Indien covers that area.

### Canada CAPS (Canadian Arctic Prediction System)

ECCC End-Use Licence, no auth on Datamart. 2× daily, 48 h horizon. Pan-Arctic + mid-latitude extension. Niche but covers Greenland / Arctic Ocean / high Arctic where HRDPS continental and HRRR-Alaska don't reach.

## NWP — Tier 3

### MET Nordic / MEPS (Norway)

Deferred 2026-05-08 after DMI DINI's true grid extent was confirmed via Open-Meteo's published DINI map. DINI's computational grid actually reaches northern Scandinavia and most of Finland (the DMI marketing map shows only the inner "useful" area). MEPS is post-processed to 1 km vs DINI's 2 km native, but 1 km vs 2 km is only visible at zoom 9+, and the MEPS-unique territory is just the very-northern Norway tip and Murmansk strip — tens of thousands of people. `data.met.no` is THREDDS/NetCDF, a novel fetch path requiring new infrastructure.

Revisit if a Nordic-fidelity feature ever becomes a priority.

### KNMI HARMONIE-AROME Europe (P3)

Same physics as DMI DINI, but regridded down to 5.5 km (0.05° rotated lat-lon) — DMI gives \~7× more pixels at the same domain. KNMI also requires per-user API-key registration. Picking DMI DINI is strictly better.

### KNMI HARMONIE-AROME Netherlands (P1)

2 km native over NL + BE, hourly. DMI DINI already covers the Netherlands at the same 2 km native, so this is redundant. Same API-key blocker as the Europe variant.

### Météo-France ARPEGE Europe

Confusion-prone name — this is the **global ARPEGE model** at 11 km (0.1°), NOT the high-resolution AROME family. Coarser than ICON-EU at 7 km and barely different from IFS at 9 km. Skip entirely. The Météo-France model worth wanting is **AROME-France** at 1.3 km, which needs an API key (auto-Tier-3).

### ICON-D2 (DWD Germany)

2.2 km central-Europe coverage, hourly cycles. Subsumed by DMI DINI's 2 km coverage of the same area at 3-hourly cycles — DINI's higher native resolution and broader domain wins on every axis except cycle frequency, and the cycle-frequency advantage of ICON-D2 doesn't materially affect tile rendering since the blend at T+10min is dominated by the radar side anyway.

### DMI DINI overlap models (skip all)

These are all in the DMI DINI domain at coarser native resolution, often with API-key gates: KNMI harmonie-arome-netherlands (Cy43 P1, requires KNMI API key), Belgium alaro-belgium, Czechia chmi-lam, Slovakia aladin-slovakia (4.5 km, coarser than DINI), Slovenia aladin-slovenia (4 km), Croatia aladin-hr (password-gated open data), Ireland harmonie-arome-ireland (Met Éireann; DINI fully covers Ireland at similar res), Austria arome-austria, Hungary arome-hungary.

### Switzerland — ICON-CH-EPS

Ensemble-only, not deterministic. LibreWXR's tile rendering needs deterministic output.

### Israel — COSMO-IL / ICON-IL

Israeli IMS requires signing a Terms of Use PDF and emailing it. Open licence in principle but operational friction (each self-host operator must register individually) — auto-Tier-3 under the no-API-keys spirit even if not the letter.

### Norway — AROME-Arctic

Svalbard + Barents Sea. Deferred along with MET Nordic.

### Japan — JMA LFM (MSM moved to Implemented)

LFM (Local Forecast Model — 2 km, Japan-area-only) remains blocked. JMBSC is the sole distributor for LFM's raw GRIB output; only via paid contract, no anonymous public endpoint. Open-Meteo does not republish LFM to AWS Open Data (only MSM — see the Implemented section).

GSM (global 13 km) is available via NOMADS / WMO GTS mirrors at 0.5° / \~55 km — worse than IFS, not worth integrating.

The 2026-05-08 survey originally listed both MSM and LFM here as "structurally blocked" because Open-Meteo's *direct query API* docs mention licence restrictions. That note was correct about JMA's *direct* feed but missed that Open-Meteo separately republishes MSM (not LFM) to AWS Open Data Sponsorship under the same arrangement that makes IFS / NCEP / DMI usable. Discovered + shipped 2026-05-30 — see the JMA MSM entry under NWP — Implemented.

### China — CMA models

Structurally blocked (verified 2026-05-08). Open-Meteo's CMA downloader requires a `--server` private credentialed URL just like JMA. `data.cma.cn` and `nmc.gov.cn` are browse-only; the WIS2 node publishes discovery metadata but the actual GRIB feeds remain on the WMO-restricted GTS pipe. No CMA bucket on AWS Open Data Registry. GRAPES-GFS is also only 0.125° (\~14 km), coarser than IFS — no upgrade even if it opened up.

### Korea — KMA LDPS / KIM

Structurally blocked (verified 2026-05-08). Anonymous FTP at `ncms.kma.go.kr` that Open-Meteo was using was discontinued by KMA on 2026-03-31 when they switched from UM-based LDPS to KIM-based l010. The replacement `apihub.kma.go.kr` requires a per-user `authKey` query parameter with a 5 GB/day quota (20 GB for approved researchers). One LDPS model cycle (49 hourly steps × \~14 variables in GRIB2) blows through that ceiling — incompatible with serving tiles to multiple users from a single self-hosted instance.

### CWA Taiwan WRF

Dropped 2026-05-08. Projection math, byte-range fetch path, and bucket access all worked cleanly. **Killed by 6-hour temporal resolution** of the open-data publication: every product in `s3://cwaopendata/Model/` publishes only at 6-hour stride from analysis through forecast horizon. For a Rain Viewer-style animated nowcast API, each 10-min frame inside CWA's domain would render as the same 6-hour-mean rate — IFS at 1h / 9 km gives smoother animation than CWA at 6h / 3 km would.

### Other SE Asia models

BMKG Indonesia, PAGASA Philippines, Vietnam NCHMF, Thailand TMD, Mongolia — all blocked, mostly via registered-account requirements or app-only distribution policies. PAGASA's open directory at `pubfiles.pagasa.dost.gov.ph/tamss/nwp/wrf/` carries PNG/GIF charts only, not GRIB — worth a deeper dig if Philippines NWP ever becomes a priority.

### Brazil — CPTEC ETA / CPTEC-Regional

Open but native resolutions are \~7 km at 1–2× daily cycles. Marginal upgrade over IFS 9 km. WRF-SMN Argentina is the better S. America pick.

### US — NAM / RAP

Both 12–13 km, coarser than IFS at 9 km. Adding them buys little. RAP's hourly cadence is the only edge but not transformative. NBM (National Blend of Models) doesn't add resolution over HRRR. HiResW Guam is 3 km but GUCOMP radar exists for Guam and IFS 9 km is fine at typical zooms.

### Canada — HRDPS-West, RDPS

HRDPS-West is alpha datamart status with 2× daily cycles; HRDPS continental already covers BC at higher cadence. RDPS is 10 km, coarser than IFS 9 km.

## Context: WMO and open-data policy

The state of the world for radar redistribution, briefly:

- **WMO Unified Data Policy does NOT mandate radar data exchange** — radar is not classified as "core" data, so member states aren't required to share it openly.
- **WMO WIS2** (operational January 2025) has very sparse radar content. Only a few countries publish radar *metadata* there, and almost none publish the actual raster data through the WIS2 channel.
- **WMO does not produce any radar composites** — the organisation is infrastructure for sharing, not a producer.
- **The EU High Value Datasets regulation (EU 2023/138) is the legal lever** that forced European radar data open. It legally requires European meteorological data to be free, open-licensed, and API-accessible. The OPERA composite as LibreWXR consumes it is a direct consequence of that regulation.
- **AWS Open Data Sponsorship Program** is the other major channel through which countries publish radar imagery — Colombia (`s3-radaresideam`), Argentina's WRF model (`smn-ar-wrf-dataset`), and US NOAA HRRR (`noaa-hrrr-bdp-pds`) all use it. SMN Argentina's existing presence on the registry makes the radar-publication ask cheaper than starting from scratch with a country that has no AWS Open Data footprint.
- The **regional pattern** in Southeast Asia is policy-driven: Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Vietnam, Indonesia, and (until recently) Malaysia have historically blocked radar redistribution under national policy rather than technical limitation. Malaysia's MMD source shipping on CC-BY-4.0 is a regional shift worth watching — Indonesia's BMKG and Vietnam's NCHMF are the next plausible regional opens.
