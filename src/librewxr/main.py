# extra being importable AND ``LIBREWXR_MCP_ENABLED``.  The MCP app's
# lifespan is combined with ``lifespan`` via ``combine_lifespans`` so
# its session manager starts AFTER LibreWXR's stores are wired (single
# mode + multi render-only both flow through the one ``lifespan``
# function, so a single combine call covers both modes -- the R2
# refinement from the build plan).  If the [mcp] extra is missing or
# the build throws, MCP is silently disabled and the app boots lean.
