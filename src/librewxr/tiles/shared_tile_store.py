"""Shared on-disk encoded-tile store for multi-mode render workers.

In a multi-worker deployment every render worker independently encodes the
same tile for the same frame — the encode tail (LUT colorize, blur, WebP)
is the expensive per-request part of the render path, so N workers mean N
redundant encodes across the fleet.  This store moves those encoded bytes
onto the shared cache volume: the first worker to encode a tile publishes
it and every other worker serves the same bytes.  One encode serves all
workers.

Keys are content-versioned by the CALLER: the caller folds the frame's
content version (see ``FrameStore.frame_version``) into the key after the
leading timestamp, so the moment a frame's content changes (version bump)
or the frame is evicted, the old key becomes unreachable and the new
content is encoded under a fresh key — stale bytes are never served and
are only garbage the pruner reclaims.  Keys start with the frame timestamp
followed by "-" (e.g. ``"1712345600-v1-7-70-63-512"``); that timestamp
picks both the 64-way shard directory (``ts % 64``) and the invalidation
prefix, so invalidating one timestamp touches exactly one directory.

Publishes are atomic (``.<name>.tmp`` + ``os.replace`` inside the shard),
so any number of workers may publish concurrently — readers only ever see
a complete file, and concurrent identical publishes converge on the last
``os.replace`` (same content, last write wins).  Cleanup is age-aware:
construction-time sweeping unlinks only ``*.tmp`` files older than
``_STALE_TMP_AGE_S`` and a full-cache clear reclaims published files only
(``sweep_final_files``), so neither path can delete a live publisher's
in-flight tmp.  All file mutations are best-effort and never raise;
transient OSErrors surface as a debug log on read and a warning on write,
matching the project's no-fsync, tolerate-and-continue convention.
``prune`` is a full on-disk scan and must only be called off the event
loop.

This module is a pure storage class: no ``librewxr.config`` settings are
imported.  Callers pass ``cache_dir`` and ``max_mb``.
