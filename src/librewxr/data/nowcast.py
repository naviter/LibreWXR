"""Precipitation nowcasting via radar extrapolation and IFS blending.

Generates short-range forecast frames (default 60 minutes) by:

1. Computing optical flow between the two most recent radar frames
   (per region, with adaptive downscaling for speed).
2. Extrapolating the latest radar forward along the motion vectors.
3. Storing extrapolated frames in a lightweight ``NowcastStore`` with
   per-frame blend weights that tell the renderer how much to trust
   the extrapolation vs the ECMWF IFS forecast.

The renderer handles the actual blending — this module only produces
the extrapolated radar data and the temporal blend weight for each step.

Phase 1 (optical-flow computation) is also reused by the
``/v2/radar`` motion-arrow overlay when ``nowcast_enabled=false`` but
``arrow_flow_enabled=true``.  In that state ``generate()`` runs Phase 1
only — at a lower target resolution (tuned for the arrow draw grid) —
skipping extrapolation entirely.  The Farneback vectors land in
``NowcastStore._flows`` exactly as in the nowcast-on path, so the arrow
renderer at ``routes.radar_tile`` reads them transparently.  See
``LIBREWXR_ARROW_FLOW_ENABLED`` / ``LIBREWXR_ARROW_FLOW_TARGET_DIM``
in ``config.py`` for the tunables.

# ``NWPChain.sample()`` over a fixed lat/lon grid at T and T−1, so it
# reflects whichever regional NWP source is active at each point
# (HRRR over CONUS, ICON-EU over Europe, JMA MSM over Japan, ...) and
# not just IFS.  The per-region radar flow (``NowcastStore._flows``)
# still wins inside radar coverage; this raster only fills NWP-only
# pixels, so the radar-coverage boundary-artifact problem that
# ``_clamp_flow`` / the coverage-degradation guard exist to contain
# does not apply here — NWP grids have full-domain coverage with no
# station-range holes, and feather seams are smooth precip transitions.
#
# North/South/West are fixed; the resolution comes from
# ``settings.arrow_nwp_flow_resolution_deg`` (default 0.25°).  The
# renderer derives the per-pixel step from the loaded array's shape
# so a knob change between cycles can't drift out of sync.
