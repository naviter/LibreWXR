"""Cross-process state snapshot for the multi-worker tile-server split.

The data pipeline writes a single ``state.json`` file under the shared
cache volume after each fetch cycle.  Render-only tile-server workers
poll its mtime, re-read it on change, and call ``apply_state`` to
refresh every store in place — existing references stay valid so
in-flight renders are never interrupted.

Format::

      "version": 1,

      "stores": {
        "frame_store":  { ... __getstate__ output ... },
        "ecmwf_grid":   { ... },
        "hrrr_grid":    { ... },
        ...
      }
    }

Stores whose value is ``None`` (disabled by config) are skipped.  Stores
present in the snapshot but absent from the consumer's ``stores`` dict
are silently ignored, so a tile-server worker can be started with a
subset of stores enabled.
